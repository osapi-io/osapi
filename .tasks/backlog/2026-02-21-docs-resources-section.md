title: Add Resources documentation section

## Objective

Add a "Resources" section to the Docusaurus docs that documents what each
managed resource (System, Network, etc.) actually does. Currently the docs
cover *how to use* the API and CLI but not *what each resource manages* at
a feature level. As more providers are added (NTP, users, RPM, services),
this becomes essential.

## Reference

Use [Psion's Docusaurus docs](https://github.com/retr0h/psion) as the
template:

- `docs/docs/resources/_category_.yml` with `label: "Resources"`,
  `collapsible: true`, `collapsed: false`
- One markdown file per resource (e.g., `file.md`) with
  `sidebar_position` frontmatter
- Autogenerated sidebar picks up files automatically
- Each resource page has: description, supported operations, practical
  examples, and a reference table of fields/attributes

## Proposed Structure

```
docs/docs/sidebar/resources/
├── _category_.yml
├── system/
│   ├── _category_.yml
│   ├── hostname.md
│   ├── disk.md
│   ├── memory.md
│   └── load.md
└── network/
    ├── _category_.yml
    ├── dns.md
    └── ping.md
```

Each page should cover:

1. What the resource is and why you'd manage it
2. Supported operations (read, update, etc.)
3. Example API responses / CLI output
4. Field reference table

## README Update

Add a "Resources" link to the Documentation row in `README.md` alongside
Architecture, Getting Started, API, Usage, and Roadmap.

## Notes

- Keep pages concise -- link to API docs and CLI docs for full reference
- New resources added in the future should include a resource doc page
  as part of the "Adding a New API Domain" checklist in CLAUDE.md
